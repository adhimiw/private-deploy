# CSS Syntax Errors Fixed - Gypsy-Style Implementation

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. **CSS Syntax Error: Unexpected `}` at line 347**
**Problem**: Extra closing brace in the CSS structure causing syntax errors
**Solution**: Removed the extra closing brace and properly structured the @layer utilities section

### 2. **CSS Rules Outside @layer Structure**
**Problem**: Several CSS utility classes were placed outside of any @layer, causing parsing issues
**Solution**: Moved all utility classes inside the @layer utilities section

### 3. **Keyframe Animations Structure**
**Problem**: Keyframe animations were placed outside the main style structure
**Solution**: Created a separate style block for keyframe animations to ensure proper parsing

## Fixed CSS Structure

### Before (Problematic):
```css
@layer utilities {
    /* utilities */
}

.bg-dark { /* Outside @layer - PROBLEM */ }
.bg-card { /* Outside @layer - PROBLEM */ }
}  /* Extra closing brace - PROBLEM */

@keyframes hexagonFloat { /* Outside style block - PROBLEM */ }
```

### After (Fixed):
```css
@layer utilities {
    /* utilities */
    .bg-dark { /* Inside @layer - FIXED */ }
    .bg-card { /* Inside @layer - FIXED */ }
}
</style>

<style>
@keyframes hexagonFloat { /* In proper style block - FIXED */ }
</style>
```
